# 🧱 Building Blocks

**Building Blocks** is my personal system design practice repository. It serves as a structured collection of scalable architecture patterns, design principles, low-level design exercises, and Java-based implementations.

This is a place to learn by doing—breaking down complex systems into their fundamental components and assembling them into production-ready solutions.

## 🔍 What's Inside

- 📐 High-Level Design (HLD) case studies  
- ⚙️ Low-Level Design (LLD) implementations in Java  
- 💡 SOLID principles in action  
- 🛠️ Scalable architecture patterns  
- 🧪 Design trade-offs and alternative approaches  
- 🗃️ Notes, diagrams, and system flow breakdowns

## 🚀 Goal

To master system design from the ground up, one building block at a time.
